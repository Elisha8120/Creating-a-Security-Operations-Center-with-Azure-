# Creating-a-Security-Operations-Center-with-Azure-
I will be demonstrating how to create an at home Security Operations Center, and using a "Honey Pot" VM open on the network as bait to catch real live traffic.  



# Steps Overview 
1. I will very briefly go over setting up the virtual enviorment using Azure.
2. Next I will demonstrate how to configure log forwarding into a central repository.
3. Next we connect the repository into a SIEM, being able to query into SIEM
4. Create an attack map that shows where attackers are attacking from.
